# PR Visual Recap

PR Visual Recap is a GitHub Action that turns every pull request into a **visual code review**. On each push, an LLM coding agent runs your repo's [`visual-recap`](/docs/template-plan) skill against the PR diff, publishes a structured recap plan to the hosted Plans app, shows an informational `Visual Recap` check while it runs, and upserts **one sticky PR comment** that links to the interactive plan with an **inline screenshot** embedded right in the comment.

This is not a deterministic diff renderer. The action invokes a real coding agent (Claude Code CLI by default, or OpenAI Codex CLI) that reads the change, decides what matters, and authors the recap by calling the Plans MCP tool `create-visual-recap` — the same tool the `/visual-recap` slash command uses. You get a high-altitude, schema/API/before-after view of the change instead of a wall of raw diff.

The recap is **informational and non-blocking**. It creates a check row so reviewers can see that generation is in progress, but it is not a required check, it never blocks the PR, and it never replaces reading the actual diff. The sticky comment is a review aid, not a sign-off.

## What it does

On each PR push, the workflow:

1. Collects a bounded diff between the PR base and head.
2. Creates an informational `Visual Recap` GitHub check with `Review in progress`.
3. Runs the configured coding agent against that diff. The agent reads your repo's `visual-recap` skill and authors a recap, publishing it with `create-visual-recap`.
4. Reads the published plan URL the agent wrote to `recap-url.txt`.
5. Opens that URL in headless Chrome and screenshots the rendered plan.
6. Uploads the PNG to a signed public image route on the Plans app.
7. Upserts a single sticky PR comment that embeds the screenshot **inline** (served through GitHub's camo image proxy) next to the link to the interactive recap.
8. Completes the `Visual Recap` check as success, skipped, or neutral.

A re-push updates the same plan and the same sticky comment in place — no orphaned plans, no comment spam.

## Installing it

The Agent-Native CLI writes the workflow into your repository and prints the secrets to set:

```bash
agent-native skills add visual-plan --with-github-action
```

This installs the `visual-plan` skill (which includes the `visual-recap` skill the action runs) and writes `.github/workflows/pr-visual-recap.yml` into your repo. The workflow calls **published CLI subcommands** — `agent-native recap scan|build-prompt|shot|comment` — so nothing is copied into your repo as helper scripts. Commit the generated workflow file, set the secrets below, and open a PR to see it run.

## Backend selection

Choose which coding agent runs the skill with the `VISUAL_RECAP_AGENT` repository variable:

| `VISUAL_RECAP_AGENT` | Coding agent     | Required API key    |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| `claude` _(default)_ | Claude Code CLI  | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `codex`              | OpenAI Codex CLI | `OPENAI_API_KEY`    |

If the variable is unset, the action uses `claude`.

## Model and reasoning

Beyond the backend, two repository variables tune _how_ the agent runs:

- **`VISUAL_RECAP_MODEL`** pins the model passed to the CLI (`--model`) — for example `gpt-5.5` for Codex, or a Claude model id. Leave it unset to use the CLI's own default model.
- **`VISUAL_RECAP_REASONING`** sets the reasoning depth: `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `xhigh`. It applies to the Codex backend; Claude's reasoning is model-driven, so this variable is ignored there.

For example, to run the recap on Codex with GPT-5.5 at high reasoning, set the repository variables `VISUAL_RECAP_AGENT=codex`, `VISUAL_RECAP_MODEL=gpt-5.5`, and `VISUAL_RECAP_REASONING=high`.

## Secrets and variables

Set these in your repository's **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.

### Secrets (only two required)

| Secret              | Purpose                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PLAN_RECAP_TOKEN`  | Per-user, revocable token minted by `agent-native connect`. Authorizes publishing the recap plan and the screenshot upload. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | The LLM key for the default Claude Code backend.                                                                            |

Mint `PLAN_RECAP_TOKEN` with `agent-native connect` against your Plans app, then paste the printed token into the secret. Use a placeholder like `plan_recap_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` only for examples — never commit a real token.

### Optional (only if you change defaults)

| Secret / variable        | Default                         | When you need it                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`         | —                               | Secret. Set together with `VISUAL_RECAP_AGENT=codex` to run the recap with Codex instead.                        |
| `VISUAL_RECAP_AGENT`     | `claude`                        | Variable. Selects the coding-agent backend (`claude` or `codex`).                                                |
| `VISUAL_RECAP_MODEL`     | each CLI's default              | Variable. Pins the model — e.g. `gpt-5.5` for Codex, or a Claude model id. Unset uses the CLI's own default.     |
| `VISUAL_RECAP_REASONING` | each model's default            | Variable. Reasoning depth: `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `xhigh`. Applies to the Codex backend. |
| `PLAN_RECAP_APP_URL`     | `https://plan.agent-native.com` | Secret. Only when self-hosting the Plans app at a different origin.                                              |

The workflow auto-detects how to invoke its helper CLI (local source inside this monorepo, the published `@agent-native/core` elsewhere), so there is no `RECAP_CLI` variable to set.

## Inline screenshot in the comment

After the agent publishes the recap, the workflow screenshots the rendered plan in headless Chrome and uploads the PNG to a signed public image route on the Plans app. The sticky PR comment then embeds that screenshot **inline** — GitHub re-serves it through its camo proxy, so reviewers see a preview of the recap directly in the comment without opening anything. The link to the full interactive plan sits right next to it for when they want to explore, comment, or annotate.

## Fork-PR safety

The workflow uses the plain `pull_request` trigger, **not** `pull_request_target`. Fork PRs therefore run with **no access to repository secrets**, so the recap step finds no `PLAN_RECAP_TOKEN` and cleanly no-ops — no failed publish, no error comment, no leaked credentials. Recaps only run for PRs from branches in the same repository, where the secrets are available.

This also means you can merge the workflow file **before** the secrets exist: with no token configured, every run is a quiet no-op until you set the secrets.

## Local-files privacy mode

The GitHub Action is designed for hosted, shareable PR review. If you want a
recap without sending recap content to the Agent-Native Plan database, run the
same helper flow locally in local-files mode instead:

```bash
agent-native recap collect-diff --base main --head HEAD --out recap.diff --stat recap.stat
agent-native recap scan --diff recap.diff
agent-native recap build-prompt --pr 123 --diff recap.diff --stat recap.stat --local-files --local-dir plans/pr-123-visual-recap
```

Give the generated `recap-prompt.md` to your coding agent. In local-files mode
the prompt instructs the agent to write `plans/pr-123-visual-recap/plan.mdx`
plus optional visual files and then run:

```bash
agent-native plan local preview --dir plans/pr-123-visual-recap --kind recap
```

The returned `file://` preview, or `/local-plans/pr-123-visual-recap` in a local
Plan app using the same `PLAN_LOCAL_DIR`, is the review link. This mode disables
the hosted sticky PR comment, inline screenshot upload, usage attachment, and
browser comments until you explicitly publish.

## It's informational, not a gate

The recap is a review aid layered on top of the normal PR flow:

- It shows a `Visual Recap` check row for visibility, but it is **never a required check** and never blocks merging.
- A generation or publish failure completes neutrally and surfaces as an explanatory sticky comment, not a red X on unrelated code.
- The recap and its screenshot **do not imply the diff has been reviewed**. Reviewers still need to read the actual changed lines.
