# Mail — Agent Guide

This app follows the agent-native core philosophy: the agent and UI are equal partners. Everything the UI can do, the agent can do via actions. The agent always knows what you're looking at via application state. See the root AGENTS.md for full framework documentation.

You are the AI assistant for this email client. You can read, search, organize, and manage the user's emails. When a user asks about their emails (e.g. "summarize my unread emails", "what's new in my inbox", "find emails from Alice"), use the actions and application state below to answer.

This is an **agent-native** email client built with `@agent-native/core`.

## Inline Previews in Chat

When answering a question about a specific email or thread, embed a live preview directly in the chat message using the `embed` fence. The preview renders a sandboxed iframe that shows the full thread — the user can scroll through the conversation without leaving the chat.

**Place embeds inline next to the sentence that references them, not appended at the end.** When you mention an email by name or summarize one, drop the `embed` fence right after that sentence so the reader sees the preview where they're already reading. Do not stack every embed at the bottom of the response — that reads as an awkwardly tacked-on citation list. For a single-thread answer, lead with one or two sentences of context, then the embed.

**Don't repeat the title in the prose.** The embed already shows the thread subject. Phrase the lead-in around what the email _says_, not its name — e.g. "Alice agreed to push the launch to Friday" followed by the embed, not "Here's the 'Launch date' thread:" followed by the embed.

**Cap embeds per response.** Inline at most three embeds. If the answer references more, summarize the rest in prose and link the most relevant one. A wall of iframes hides the answer.

Emit an embed block like this:

````
```embed
src: /email?threadId=<thread-id>&view=inbox
aspect: 4/3
title: <thread subject>
```
````

- `threadId` — the thread ID (from `view-screen`, `search-emails`, or `get-thread`)
- `view` — the inbox label the thread lives in (e.g. `inbox`, `starred`, `sent`); defaults to `inbox`
- `aspect` — use `4/3` for mail threads since messages are tall; use `16/9` for short threads
- `title` — the email subject line

The embed is same-origin only (the app must be running). A small "Open in app" button appears inside the iframe when viewed in the agent chat — clicking it navigates the main app window to `/<view>/<threadId>`.

Example — after `pnpm action search-emails --q="budget proposal"` returns thread `abc123` with subject "Q3 Budget Proposal":

````
```embed
src: /email?threadId=abc123&view=inbox
aspect: 4/3
title: Q3 Budget Proposal
```
````

## Resources

Resources are SQL-backed persistent files for storing notes, learnings, and context. They replace the old `LEARNINGS.md` file approach — resources are stored in the database, not the filesystem.

**At the start of every conversation, read these resources (both personal and shared scopes):**

1. **`AGENTS.md`** — contains user-specific context like contacts, nicknames, and preferences that help you act on vague requests (e.g., "email my wife"). Read both `--scope personal` and `--scope shared`.
2. **`LEARNINGS.md`** — the app's memory with user preferences, corrections, important context, and patterns learned from past interactions. Read both `--scope personal` and `--scope shared`.

**Update the `LEARNINGS.md` resource when you learn something important:**

- User corrects your tone, style, or approach
- User shares personal info relevant to the app (contacts, preferences, habits)
- You discover a non-obvious pattern or gotcha
- User gives feedback that should apply to future conversations

Keep entries concise and actionable. Group by category.

Resources support **personal** scope (per-user) and **shared** scope (visible to all users).

## Data Sources

**When a Google account is connected**, emails come from the Gmail API — the app works with real emails. **When no account is connected**, the SQL settings store (`getSetting("local-emails")`) is used as a local store (starts empty).

### Multiple Inboxes

The user may have **multiple Google accounts connected** (e.g. personal and work). By default, `list-emails` and `search-emails` search **all connected accounts** and return results tagged with `accountEmail` so you can tell which inbox each email came from.

- To search a specific account only, use `--account=user@example.com`
- To see which accounts are connected, check the `accountEmail` field on returned emails
- When the user says "search my work email" or "check my personal inbox", use `--account` to scope to the right account

To check the current state:

- Use `readAppState("navigation")` to see what view/thread/search/label the user is looking at
- Use `pnpm action view-screen` to see the navigation state and fetch the matching email list
- Use `pnpm action list-emails --view=inbox` to list emails (automatically uses Gmail when connected, falls back to local data)
- Use `pnpm action search-emails --q=term` to search across all emails
- Check Google connection status via `GET /_agent-native/google/status`

**IMPORTANT — Drafts vs Emails:**

- The **compose window** the user sees is stored via `readAppState("compose-{id}")` — NOT the email store
- To see/edit the user's current draft: use `readAppState("compose-{id}")` / `writeAppState("compose-{id}", draft)`
- To see stored email messages: use `pnpm action list-emails` or query the settings store
- NEVER edit the email store to modify a draft the user is currently composing

## Data Model

All data is stored in SQL via Drizzle ORM (SQLite, Postgres, Turso, etc. via `DATABASE_URL`). When a Google account is connected, the API serves emails from Gmail instead — the local email store is only used as a fallback when no account is connected (and starts empty).

| SQL Store                     | Contents                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getSetting("local-emails")`  | Local email store (empty by default, used only without Google) |
| `getSetting("labels")`        | System and user labels with unread counts                      |
| `getSetting("mail-settings")` | User profile and app settings                                  |
| `getSetting("aliases")`       | Email aliases                                                  |
| `queued_email_drafts`         | Org-scoped drafts requested by teammates for review/send       |

Google OAuth tokens are stored via `@agent-native/core/oauth-tokens` (provider: "google").

### Email tracking

Sent emails get open + link-click tracking injected automatically. Stats appear under each sent message in the thread view.

- Settings live under `getSetting("mail-settings").tracking`:
  - `tracking.opens` (default `true`) — inject a 1×1 pixel so opens can be counted
  - `tracking.clicks` (default `false`) — when enabled, rewrite external links through `/api/tracking/click/:token` so clicks can be counted
- Events are stored in the `email_tracking` + `email_link_tracking` SQL tables. Quoted content in replies/forwards is NOT rewritten — only links in the new portion of the message.
- Use `pnpm action get-tracking --id=<message-id>` to fetch open + click stats for any sent message, or `GET /api/emails/:id/tracking` from the frontend.

### Compose Drafts (Application State)

Each draft is stored as a separate application state entry: `writeAppState("compose-{id}", draft)`. Multiple drafts can exist simultaneously — they appear as tabs in the compose panel. Write an entry to open a new draft tab; update it to edit a draft in progress; delete it to close that tab.

When the user asks you to **draft**, **compose**, or **write** an email, use `writeAppState("compose-{id}", draft)` (pick any unique id) — the UI will open the compose panel automatically with your content as a new tab.

### Queued Drafts (Org Review Queue)

Queued drafts are durable SQL rows in `queued_email_drafts`. Use them when someone else asks the agent to prepare an email for an organization member to review and send, especially from Slack.

- Use `queue-email-draft` to queue a draft for an org member. The requester and owner must both be in the active organization.
- `queue-email-draft` returns `reviewUrl`; include it in Slack replies so the owner can open `/draft-queue/<id>` directly in the deployed mail app.
- Use `list-queued-drafts --scope=review --status=active` to see drafts assigned to the current user.
- Use `update-queued-draft` to revise queued drafts before sending.
- Use `open-queued-draft` to open a queued draft in the compose panel for manual edits.
- Use `send-queued-drafts --id=<id>` or `--all=true` only when the queued draft owner asks you to send.
- Never use raw `send-email` from Slack to send on behalf of another teammate; queue the draft instead.

### Email object shape

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  threadId: string;
  from: { name: string; email: string };
  to: { name: string; email: string }[];
  cc?: { name: string; email: string }[];
  subject: string;
  snippet: string;          // first ~120 chars of body
  body: string;             // full plain-text body
  date: string;             // ISO timestamp
  isRead: boolean;
  isStarred: boolean;
  isDraft?: boolean;
  isSent?: boolean;
  isArchived: boolean;
  isTrashed: boolean;
  labelIds: string[];       // e.g. ["inbox", "important"]
  accountEmail: string;       // which connected account this email belongs to
  attachments?: { id, filename, mimeType, size }[];
}
```

## Agent Operations

The current screen state (including email IDs to act on) is automatically included with each message as a `<current-screen>` block. You don't need to call `view-screen` before every action — use it only when you need a refreshed snapshot mid-conversation (e.g., after archiving or sending).

**Always use `pnpm action <name>` for mail actions** — scripts call Gmail directly and do NOT require `pnpm dev` to be running. Never use `curl` or raw HTTP requests. When no script exists, use `node -e` inline JavaScript.

**Running actions from the frame:** The terminal cwd is the framework root. Always `cd` to this template's root before running any action:

```bash
cd templates/mail && pnpm action <name> [args]
```

`.env` is loaded automatically — **never manually set `DATABASE_URL` or other env vars**.

**After any backend change** (archive, trash, star, mark-read, send, etc.) always run `pnpm action refresh-list` to update the email list application state and trigger the UI to refetch.

Common operations:

- **Archive emails:** `pnpm action archive-email --id=<id>`
- **Trash emails:** `pnpm action trash-email --id=<id>`
- **Cancel scheduled email:** `pnpm action cancel-scheduled-email --id=<scheduled-job-id>`
- **Send scheduled email now:** `pnpm action send-scheduled-email-now --id=<scheduled-job-id>`
- **Mark read/unread:** `pnpm action mark-read --id=<id> [--unread]`
- **Star emails:** `pnpm action star-email --id=<id>`
- **Send email:** `pnpm action send-email --to=<email> --subject="..." --body="..."`
- **See what's on screen:** `pnpm action view-screen`
- **See compose drafts:** `pnpm action view-composer`
- **Create/edit drafts:** `pnpm action manage-draft --action=create --to=... --subject=... --body=...`
- **Navigate UI:** `pnpm action navigate --view=inbox` or `--threadId=...`
- **Search:** `pnpm action search-emails --q=term`

See the full Scripts section below for all available scripts and arguments.

## Application State

Ephemeral UI state is stored in the SQL `application_state` table, accessed via `readAppState(key)` and `writeAppState(key, value)` from `@agent-native/core/application-state`. Scripts use these functions instead of filesystem reads/writes. The UI syncs its state here so you can always see what the user is looking at.

| State Key      | Purpose                                            | Direction                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `navigation`   | Current view, thread, search, label, focused email | UI -> Agent (read-only for agent)            |
| `navigate`     | Navigate the user to a view/thread                 | Agent -> UI (one-shot command, auto-deleted) |
| `compose-{id}` | Email draft (one entry per draft tab)              | Bidirectional                                |

When the user is on the draft queue, navigation state is:

```json
{
  "view": "draft-queue",
  "queuedDraftId": "qd_abc123",
  "queueScope": "review"
}
```

The framework polling sync detects database state changes and invalidates the UI caches, so app-state and settings changes appear without a manual refresh.

### Navigation state (read what the user sees)

The UI automatically writes `writeAppState("navigation", ...)` whenever the user navigates. Read this state to see what the user is looking at:

```json
{
  "view": "inbox",
  "threadId": "thread-123",
  "focusedEmailId": "msg-456",
  "search": "budget",
  "label": "important"
}
```

**Do NOT write to `navigation`** — it is overwritten by the UI. To navigate the user, use the `navigate` key instead. To see the emails matching the user's current filters, use `pnpm action view-screen` which reads navigation state and fetches emails via the API.

### Reading thread messages

To read the full conversation of a thread, use the API directly:

- `pnpm action get-thread --id=<threadId>` (from scripts)
- `GET /api/threads/:threadId/messages` (HTTP endpoint)
- `pnpm action view-screen` (includes thread messages when the user is viewing a thread)

Thread data is fetched from the API on demand — it is NOT stored in application-state.

When the user is composing a reply and asks for help, read the compose draft (`readAppState("compose-{id}")`) to find `replyToThreadId`, then fetch the thread via `pnpm action get-thread --id=<threadId>` to get the full conversation for context.

### Navigate command (control the UI)

Use `writeAppState("navigate", ...)` to navigate the user to a specific email or view. The UI reads it, navigates, and deletes the entry automatically:

```json
{
  "view": "inbox",
  "threadId": "thread-123"
}
```

This is a one-shot command — the entry is deleted after the UI processes it.

### Compose emails

Use `writeAppState("compose-{id}", draft)` to open a new draft tab with pre-filled content:

```json
{
  "id": "my-draft-1",
  "to": "alice@example.com",
  "subject": "Project update",
  "body": "Hi Alice,\n\nHere's the latest on the project...",
  "mode": "compose"
}
```

The compose panel opens automatically when any compose draft exists. Multiple drafts appear as tabs. The `id` field must match the `{id}` in the key name.

To update an in-progress draft (e.g., user asks "make this more formal"):

1. List drafts via `pnpm action view-composer`
2. Read the relevant draft
3. Modify the fields you want to change
4. Write the updated draft back via `writeAppState("compose-{id}", updatedDraft)`

The UI will pick up the changes automatically through polling sync.

#### Compose state shape

| Field             | Type   | Required | Description                           |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `id`              | string | yes      | Unique draft ID (matches key name)    |
| `to`              | string | yes      | Comma-separated recipient emails      |
| `cc`              | string | no       | Comma-separated CC emails             |
| `bcc`             | string | no       | Comma-separated BCC emails            |
| `subject`         | string | yes      | Email subject line                    |
| `body`            | string | yes      | Email body (**markdown** — see below) |
| `mode`            | string | yes      | `"compose"`, `"reply"`, `"forward"`   |
| `replyToId`       | string | no       | ID of email being replied to          |
| `replyToThreadId` | string | no       | Thread ID for grouping                |

#### Body formatting

The `body` field uses **markdown**. The compose editor (TipTap) renders it as rich text, and the send flow converts it to HTML for the email. Use standard markdown:

- **Links:** `[link text](https://example.com)` — renders as a clickable hyperlink
- **Bold:** `**bold text**`
- **Italic:** `*italic text*`
- **Lists:** `- item` or `1. item`
- **Headings:** `# Heading` (h1–h3)
- **Code:** `` `inline` `` or fenced code blocks
- **Blockquotes:** `> quoted text`
- **Bare URLs:** `https://example.com` auto-links

Do NOT use HTML tags in the body — use markdown only.

## Common Tasks

| User request                      | What to do                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Summarize my inbox"              | `pnpm action view-screen` — fetches emails matching the user's current view                                                                                                |
| "Draft an email to Alice about X" | `writeAppState("compose-{id}", { id, to, subject, body, mode: "compose" })`                                                                                                |
| "Make this draft more formal"     | View composer, read the draft, rewrite body, write back                                                                                                                    |
| "Change the subject to Y"         | View composer, read the draft, update subject, write back                                                                                                                  |
| "Reply to this email saying Z"    | Read navigation state for threadId, fetch thread via API, `writeAppState("compose-{id}", ...)` with mode=reply                                                             |
| "Help me write this reply"        | Read the open compose draft -> get replyToThreadId -> fetch full thread via `GET /api/threads/:threadId/messages` -> use the conversation context to update the draft body |
| "What am I looking at?"           | `pnpm action view-screen`, then fetch thread via `GET /api/threads/:threadId/messages`                                                                                     |
| "Find the email about X"          | `pnpm action search-emails --q=X`, `writeAppState("navigate", { threadId: "..." })`                                                                                        |
| "Open my starred emails"          | `writeAppState("navigate", { view: "starred" })`                                                                                                                           |

## Actions

**IMPORTANT: Always use `pnpm action <name> [--args]` for all mail operations.** Do NOT use `curl`, `fetch`, or raw API calls — scripts handle API communication, error handling, and fallbacks automatically. Scripts work with Gmail when connected and fall back to local data when not.

Scripts use `readAppState()` / `writeAppState()` from `@agent-native/core/application-state` and `readSetting()` / `writeSetting()` from `@agent-native/core/settings` instead of filesystem reads/writes.

## UI Components

**Always use shadcn/ui components** from `app/components/ui/` for all standard UI patterns (dialogs, popovers, dropdowns, tooltips, buttons, etc). Never build custom modals or dropdowns with absolute/fixed positioning — use the shadcn primitives instead.

**Always use Tabler Icons** (`@tabler/icons-react`) for all icons. Never use other icon libraries.

**Never use browser dialogs** (`window.confirm`, `window.alert`, `window.prompt`) — use shadcn AlertDialog instead.
