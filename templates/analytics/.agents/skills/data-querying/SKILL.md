# Data Querying

The analytics app connects to multiple data sources. This skill covers general patterns for querying data effectively.

## Approach

1. **Read the relevant provider skill first** — check `.builder/skills/<provider>/SKILL.md` for table names, column mappings, auth, and gotchas
2. **Use existing scripts** — run `pnpm action <name> --arg=value` with `--grep` and `--fields` for filtering
3. **Write ad-hoc scripts** — if no existing script covers the question, create one in `actions/`
4. **Present data in chat** — don't just say "check the dashboard" — actually query, get the data, and present it

For events recorded by the analytics template itself via its `/track` endpoint, use `pnpm action query-agent-native-analytics --sql "SELECT ... FROM analytics_events ..."`. This includes pageviews, site/app traffic, template usage, app usage, and event counts collected by this analytics app. Pageviews and traffic can also live in GA4, BigQuery/warehouse tables, Mixpanel, PostHog, Amplitude, or another configured provider, so choose the source from the user's wording, connected-source status, existing dashboards, data dictionary, and user/org resources. Ask one concise clarification if multiple configured sources are plausible. Do not use `db-query` for data-source analysis; `db-query` is only for internal app tables and will confuse analytics questions. The shipped `agent-native-templates-first-party` SQL dashboard is the template engagement dashboard for the first-party collector source.

Example pageviews query for a local calendar day:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS pageviews
FROM analytics_events
WHERE event_name = 'pageview'
  AND timestamp >= '<start-utc>'
  AND timestamp < '<end-utc>'
```

Convert the user's requested local date/timezone to UTC before querying. For
example, May 1, 2026 in America/New_York is `2026-05-01T04:00:00Z`
through `2026-05-02T04:00:00Z`.

## Built-in Filtering

All scripts that use `output()` support universal flags:

```bash
# Case-insensitive search across all values
pnpm action hubspot-deals --grep="enterprise"

# Pick specific fields from results
pnpm action hubspot-deals --fields=dealname,amount,stageLabel

# Combine both
pnpm action seo-top-keywords --grep=remix --fields=keyword,rank_absolute,etv
```

## Showing Charts In Chat

For an in-chat answer, **emit a live `/chart` embed** — never `generate-chart`. The embed mounts a live `SqlChart` that re-queries when its source changes, and it doesn't choke on rigid JSON params the way the PNG action does. Full shape in `AGENTS.md` ("Inline Charts in Chat" section). Reach for `generate-chart` only when you're building a `save-analysis` artifact whose markdown will render outside the app.

If `generate-chart` returns an error in any chat-answering flow, the recovery is to switch to the live embed, not to retry with reformatted params.

## Script Patterns

### Reusing Existing Scripts

```bash
# GitHub PRs
pnpm action github-prs --org=<org> --query="is:open label:bug"

# Jira tickets
pnpm action jira-search --jql="summary ~ SSO" --fields=key,summary,status

# HubSpot deals
pnpm action hubspot-deals --fields=dealname,amount,stageLabel

# SEO keywords
pnpm action seo-top-keywords --grep=remix --fields=keyword,rank_absolute,etv
```

### Writing Ad-Hoc Scripts

When no existing script covers the question:

1. Create a new script in `actions/` that imports the relevant server lib
2. Run it via `pnpm action <name>`
3. For one-off queries, you can delete the script after
4. For reusable queries, keep the script

```ts
// scripts/my-query.ts
import { runQuery } from "../server/lib/bigquery.js";
import { output } from "./helpers.js";

export default async function main(args: string[]) {
  const results = await runQuery("SELECT ...");
  output(results);
}
```

## Cross-Referencing Sources

For complete answers, combine data from multiple sources:

- **BigQuery** for analytics events, signups, pageviews
- **First-party Analytics** (`query-agent-native-analytics`) for events collected through `/track`
- **HubSpot** for CRM data — deals, contacts, revenue
- **Jira** for engineering metrics — tickets, sprints
- **GitHub** for code metrics — PRs, reviews
- **Sentry** for error rates and trends
- **Grafana** for infrastructure metrics

## Important Notes

- Always query real data — never guess or approximate
- Use `--grep` and `--fields` to narrow output, don't pipe through grep
- Update the relevant `.builder/skills/<provider>/SKILL.md` when you discover new patterns
- For BigQuery queries, check `.builder/skills/bigquery/SKILL.md` for table schemas first
