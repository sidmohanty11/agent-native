/**
 * Lib helpers in `server/lib/*.ts` (bigquery, hubspot, slack, etc.) all need
 * to resolve credentials. Credentials are now per-user / per-org and require
 * a CredentialContext. To avoid threading the context through every public
 * method of every helper (which would force every action and every script to
 * pass it explicitly), the helpers grab it from the active request context
 * via `getCredentialContext()` from `@agent-native/core/server`.
 *
 * Where the context comes from:
 *   - Framework actions auto-mounted at `/_agent-native/actions/...` —
 *     `runWithRequestContext({ userEmail, orgId }, fn)` is called for you.
 *   - Custom `/api/*` routes — wrap the handler body in
 *     `withRequestContextFromEvent(event, async (ctx) => { ... })` from
 *     `./credentials.ts`. The wrapper reads the session and runs `fn`
 *     inside `runWithRequestContext`.
 *
 * Calling a lib helper outside any request context (e.g. from a CLI script
 * with no AGENT_USER_EMAIL env var) will throw a clear error pointing the
 * developer at the missing wrapping. This is intentional — the previous
 * "fall back to process.env" behavior is exactly the leak we're fixing.
