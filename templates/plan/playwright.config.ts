 * fullyParallel + multiple workers => many browser contexts at once (this is the
 * parallelism browser testing needs). Retries absorb transient HMR reloads while
 * other agents edit the app. Auth is established once in global-setup and reused
 * via storageState; guest specs opt out with their own fresh context.
