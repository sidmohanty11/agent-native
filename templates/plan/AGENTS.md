# Agent-Native Plans — Agent Guide

Agent-Native Plans is a local-first structured visual plan mode for coding
agents. Its job is to turn agent plans into editable rich blocks, diagrams,
wireframes, prototype options, annotations, and comments that a person can
review before code changes happen.

## Core Rules

- Follow the root framework rules: data in SQL, actions first, application
  state for navigation/selection, and shared agent chat for AI work.
- Use actions for app operations and keep frontend/API parity.
- Keep database code provider-agnostic and additive.
- Use `view-screen` or application state when the active page/selection is
  unclear.
- For new features, update UI, actions, skills/instructions, and application
  state when applicable.
- Default to structured visual artifacts over long Markdown. Text is one block
  type, not the whole plan.
- Current app actions require a real user session so plans stay scoped and
  shareable. Local development can use the framework's auto-created dev account;
  hosted persistence, private sharing, reviewer links, and cross-device/team
  workflows use account login, with Google sign-in shown when the standard
  Google OAuth env vars are configured.
- Surface material assumptions only when they change behavior, data, security,
  tests, deployment, or definition of done.
- Before edits, read pending feedback with `get-plan-feedback`.

## Application State

- `navigation.view` is `plans`, `plan`, `extensions`, or `team`.
- `navigation.planId` identifies the active visual plan when present.
- `navigate` moves the UI to the plan list or a specific visual plan.

## Visual-Question Preflight

`/visual-plan` is the main command. Before creating a plan, automatically use
`create-visual-questions` when 2-6 visual answers would materially change the
plan: fuzzy UI direction, form factor, layout model, feature scope, visual
style, architecture shape, flow depth, or multiple plausible visual options.

Skip preflight for tiny or unambiguous work, when the codebase makes the answer
clear, or when the missing detail can be safely stated as an assumption in the
plan. If the user types `/visual-questions`, treat it as a manual override and
start visual intake first.

## Skills

Use `.agents/skills/visual-plan/SKILL.md` for Agent-Native Plans behavior. Use
`.agents/skills/ui-plan/SKILL.md` for UI-first visual plans where an optional
top pan/zoom wireframe or diagram canvas comes before a refined Notion-like
document with rich tabs, tables, sketchy diagrams, code tabs, comments/drawing
space, and agent handoff. Use
`.agents/skills/visual-questions/SKILL.md` when the agent should ask rich
visual intake questions before creating a plan. Use
`.agents/skills/visualize-plan/SKILL.md` when the agent already has a Codex,
Claude Code, Markdown, or pasted text plan and should create a visual companion.
The exported install flow is simple:
`agent-native skills add visual-plan` installs the `/visual-plan`,
`/visual-questions`, `/ui-plan`, and `/visualize-plan` skills plus the MCP
connector. In
Claude Code, Codex, and other supported hosts, users can then type
`/visual-plan` for a fresh general plan, `/visual-questions` for visual intake
before a plan, `/ui-plan` for a UI-first plan, or `/visualize-plan` to enrich
an existing text plan.
Read the relevant root skill before implementation: `adding-a-feature`,
`actions`, `storing-data`, `real-time-sync`, `security`, `delegate-to-agent`,
`frontend-design`, `shadcn-ui`, and `self-modifying-code`.
