# Agent-Native Plans

Agent-Native Plans is structured visual planning mode for coding agents.
Generate the kind of plan you would normally write in Markdown, but as a
scannable plan document with editable blocks mixed in: diagrams, wireframes,
mockups, prototype options, tradeoff cards, file/symbol implementation maps,
code previews, bounded custom HTML fragments, and annotation prompts. It is a
plan document, not a marketing page.

The goal is impatient review. The user should be able to react to visuals first
and read prose only where it helps.

## Install And Use

Users install Plans with the Agent-Native CLI:

```sh
agent-native skills add plans
```

That one command installs `/visual-plan`, `/ui-plan`, `/visual-questions`, and
`/visualize-plan` and registers the hosted MCP app connector for supported hosts
such as Claude Code and Codex.

Use `/visual-plan` for a fresh general plan. Use `/ui-plan` when the work is
primarily product UI and the review should start with high-fidelity screens and
states. Use `/visual-questions` when the agent should ask a visual intake form
before choosing the plan direction. Use `/visualize-plan` when there is already
a Codex, Claude Code, Markdown, or pasted text plan that should become an HTML
companion.

## Slash Commands

- `/visual-plan`: create a fresh rich visual plan before implementation. Include
  a docs-level plan, visual architecture/flow diagrams, detailed wireframes or
  mockups when UI is involved, an implementation map with files/symbols/snippets,
  tradeoffs, open questions, and clear feedback prompts.
- `/ui-plan`: create a UI-first high-fidelity visual plan before implementation.
  Use an optional top pan/zoom wireframe or diagram canvas when visuals clarify
  the flow, then continue as a refined Notion-like document with rich tabs,
  comments/drawing prompts, code tabs, and agent handoff notes.
- `/visual-questions`: create a rich visual intake questionnaire before a plan.
  Use this for chips, freeform answers, mockup choice tabs, sketch diagrams, and
  a generated answer summary that can feed `/ui-plan`, `/visual-plan`, or
  `/visualize-plan`.
- `/visualize-plan`: import an existing Codex, Claude Code, Markdown, or pasted
  text plan and turn it into a visual companion. Preserve the plan's intent,
  then add diagrams, wireframes, option cards, file/symbol maps, and annotation
  prompts.

## When To Use

Create or update a visual plan when:

- the user asks for a plan, HTML plan, visual plan, plannotate-style review,
  diagrams, wireframes, mockups, prototypes, comments, or annotations;
- work is multi-file, ambiguous, long-running, risky, or UI-heavy;
- the user is unlikely to read a long text plan closely;
- architecture, data flow, UI direction, options, or open questions would be
  clearer visually;
- you need the user to react before implementation.

## Plan Discipline

Plan mode protects the user from wasted work; it is not ceremony. Hold this
discipline before and around the plan document:

- **Right-size first.** Build a visual plan when work is multi-file, ambiguous,
  risky, architectural, UI-heavy, has multiple valid approaches, or the code is
  unfamiliar. Skip it for trivial, unambiguous work — typos, one-line fixes, a
  single well-specified function, anything whose diff you could describe in one
  sentence — and just make the change. A polished visual plan is the most
  expensive plan form; only invest when a wrong direction is costly. Never pad a
  plan with filler or ship a single-step plan.
- **Research before you draft.** Read the real files, actions, schema, and
  existing patterns first, and name actual files, symbols, and data shapes in
  the plan instead of inventing them. Check existing `actions/` before proposing
  endpoints and prefer named client helpers over raw fetch. Delegate wide
  exploration to a sub-agent so the main context stays clear.
- **Planning is read-only.** Make no source edits while building or reviewing
  the plan. Start editing code only after the user approves the direction.
- **Clarify vs. assume.** Do not ask the user how to build it — explore and
  present the approach and options in the plan. Ask a clarifying question only
  when an ambiguity would change the design and you cannot resolve it from the
  code or a sensible default; batch a small set (2-4) of high-leverage,
  decision-changing questions before finalizing. Otherwise state the most
  reasonable assumption explicitly and proceed. Put anything still unresolved in
  a dedicated open-questions / needs-clarification block — never guess silently,
  and never fill it with detail you could infer.
- **Be specific.** Every plan states the objective and what "done" means,
  explicit scope and non-goals, ordered verifiable steps that name real files,
  symbols, and actions, the key choices with rationale, risks, and a closing
  verification step (tests, build, or a checkable behavior). Replace vague prose
  with specifics; never ship a step like "make it work."
- **The plan is the approval gate.** After surfacing the plan, explicitly ask
  the user to review and approve before you write any code, and name which
  files/areas and permissions the work will touch so approval grants scope.
  Presenting the plan and requesting sign-off is the approval step — do not ask
  a separate "does this look good?" question.
- **The document is the source of truth, not the chat.** When scope shifts
  during review or implementation, update the plan with `update-visual-plan`
  rather than only changing course in chat, and re-read the approved plan before
  major steps so the work does not drift.

## Core Workflow

1. Call `create-visual-plan` with the title, brief, source, repo path, and
   either structured `content` blocks or readable `sections` before
   implementation.
2. Prefer structured `content` for every new plan. Use `rich-text`,
   `sketch-diagram`, `sketch-wireframe`, `tabs`, `code-tabs`,
   `implementation-map`, `decision`, `checklist`, `table`,
   `visual-questions`, and bounded `custom-html` blocks. Do not send a full
   standalone HTML document unless importing a legacy artifact.
3. Surface the returned Agent-Native Plans link or inline MCP App. In CLI hosts,
   ask the user to review the plan visually.
4. Call `get-plan-feedback` before editing, after review, after any long pause,
   and before final response.
5. Incorporate comments/corrections with `update-visual-plan`. Prefer
   `contentPatches` for targeted changes: `update-rich-text`, `replace-block`,
   `update-wireframe-region`, `replace-wireframe-regions`,
   `update-canvas-frame`, `append-block`, `remove-block`, or
   `update-custom-html`. Use full `content` only for broad restructuring.
6. Export an HTML/JSON/Markdown receipt with `export-visual-plan` when the user
   wants a shareable artifact.

## Visual Defaults

- Use implementation-plan structure first: objective, scope/non-goals, proposed
  approach, phases or steps, files/symbols/snippets, risks, open questions, and
  validation.
- UI work gets wireframes, state mockups, or prototype sketches.
- When UI direction is the center of the work, prefer the `ui-plan` skill so the
  mockups, states, comments/drawing space, and agent handoff come before file
  implementation detail. Keep `visual-plan` general for architecture, backend,
  refactors, and mixed implementation planning.
- Wireframes should be concrete enough to critique: show layout regions,
  controls, states, empty/loading/error paths, review affordances, and copy
  placeholders. Avoid vague rectangle-only sketches.
- Sketch wireframes and diagrams should visibly use the app-owned
  Rough.js/sketch renderer with subtle grids where useful, imperfect strokes,
  and Virgil-style labels. Labels must not overlap rough lines, connectors, or
  nodes. If the result looks like crisp boxes with normal borders, revise the
  block data or renderer before asking for review.
- For component, popover, or widget plans, show one broader app-context frame
  when placement affects understanding, then focused component states. Avoid
  fake desktop/mobile flows unless real responsive behavior changes layout.
- Layered surfaces such as popovers and floating panels need an opaque sketch
  surface; do not let background frames show through them.
- Placeholder text strokes should be sparse, aligned, and separated from labels
  so they read as content rhythm instead of noisy gray bars. In compact cards,
  use one or two thin strokes or omit strokes entirely rather than stacking bars
  into the label area.
- Keep sketch regions padded. Labels, placeholder strokes, and buttons need
  visible breathing room from rough borders; avoid placing UI marks directly on
  frame edges.
- Buttons and primary actions in UI mockups must look actionable, not like inert
  labels or decorative chips.
- When a top canvas is present, include Figma-like annotation text/arrows on the
  canvas itself, not only in prose below. Prefer plain annotation text plus
  arrows over boxed cards with borders, backgrounds, or shadows. Place each note
  close to the frame it explains, aligned with that frame when possible, instead
  of parking notes in unrelated canvas gaps.
- When showing multiple diagrams, wireframes, mockups, or design directions,
  use native `tabs` blocks so the plan stays readable and editable. Raw HTML tab
  attributes are only for legacy imported artifacts.
- Tabs for UI states, component notes, or interaction notes should include a
  relevant visual block unless they are intentionally document-only. Do not
  create large tab controls that reveal only prose.
- Backend/refactor work gets architecture, sequence, data-flow, or dependency
  diagrams.
- Complex tradeoffs get two or three option cards with consequences.
- Open questions are surfaced as visual callouts, not buried in paragraphs.
- Long prose is split into readable document sections with clear headings.
- Visuals should be review aids, not decoration. Avoid decorative hero art,
  gradient/hero backgrounds, brand/logo chrome, nav bars, slogans, fluffy value
  props, huge landing-page H1s, or marketing-style cards unless the user
  explicitly asks.
- Implementation plans include a file map: file path, symbols/components to
  touch, reason for the change, risk/coordination notes when relevant, and short
  syntax-highlighted snippets for the code shape the agent expects to modify.
- File previews should be concise and reviewable. Do not paste entire large
  files; show the key region, public API, component boundary, schema, action, or
  selector that matters for review.
- Include editor-open links where `repoPath` is known. Prefer explicit user
  clicks for opening VS Code/Cursor; never auto-open editor links.
- Include README-like details when helpful: command names, tool behavior,
  install flow, MCP/link fallback, data shape, and what is in or out of scope.
- Comments and corrections should feel plannotator-style: quick to add,
  structured enough for the agent to consume, and easy to share when the user
  chooses.

## Tool Guidance

- `create-visual-plan`: start one structured visual plan per agent task/run.
- `create-ui-plan`: start a UI-first plan with high-fidelity screen/state tabs.
- `create-visual-questions`: start a visual intake questionnaire whose answers
  feed a UI plan, visual plan, or plan update.
- `visualize-plan`: create an HTML companion from an existing text plan.
- `update-visual-plan`: revise content blocks, sections, status, or comments.
  Prefer targeted `contentPatches` over regenerating the whole plan.
  `contentPatches` are part of the public MCP action schema, so Claude Code,
  Codex, and other MCP hosts can make surgical edits without regenerating a
  whole artifact.
- `get-visual-plan`: read the current structured plan, exported HTML, and annotations.
- `get-plan-feedback`: read unconsumed human feedback. Use it frequently.
- `export-visual-plan`: export HTML, Markdown fallback, and structured JSON.

## Structured Content Guidance

- Prefer structured content blocks over raw HTML. Rich text blocks should carry
  implementation-plan substance, while diagrams, wireframes, code tabs, and
  implementation maps make the work reviewable.
- Use `custom-html` only for bounded fragments inside a block. Never include
  `html`, `head`, `body`, or `script` tags in custom fragments.
- Do not use `custom-html` as a placeholder, demo, or proof of flexibility. It
  must contain a complete useful fragment that fits the surrounding document.
- `sketch-diagram` blocks must be legible: labels cannot overlap nodes,
  connectors, rough lines, or each other; omit the diagram when it does not
  clarify a real architecture, sequence, dependency, or state relationship.
- `decision` blocks are static records unless the UI supports changing them.
  Do not style them like inactive buttons, tabs, or selectable chips.
- `implementation-map` and `code-tabs` blocks should include concrete file
  paths, language metadata, and concise snippets so rendered code can be
  highlighted.
- Match Agent-Native's restrained theme unless the user asks otherwise.
- Keep the first viewport legible and plan-like: title, brief, concise scope,
  and a useful diagram/checklist/table when it helps.
- Use tabs or small interactions only when they make review faster.
- Before handing off a visual plan, open it in the browser and fix overlap,
  excessive whitespace, clipped custom fragments, misleading inactive controls,
  poor contrast, and unreadable diagrams.
- Do not paste huge artifacts into chat. Store the plan in Plans and surface the
  MCP app or link.
- Hosted default: connect
  `https://plan.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp`. Do not put shared secrets
  in skill files.
