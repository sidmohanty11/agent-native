# UI Plan

Use `/ui-plan` when the task is primarily about product UI, user flows,
interaction states, component layout, responsive behavior, or visual direction.
This is a specialized Agent-Native Plans workflow: the reviewable UI comes
first, and implementation details come after the user has something concrete to
react to.

`/visual-plan` remains the general rich planning command for architecture,
backend, refactors, migrations, and mixed work. Use `/visual-questions` first
when the user should answer visual intake questions before a UI plan. Use
`/visualize-plan` when a text plan already exists and should become a visual
companion.

## Plan Discipline

- **Right-size first.** Use a UI plan when the surface is new, ambiguous, spans
  several screens or states, or the direction needs agreement before coding.
  Skip it for cosmetic one-liners — a color, a label, a spacing tweak — and just
  make the change.
- **Research before you draft.** Read the real components, routes, design
  tokens, and existing patterns first, and ground mockups and the file map in
  actual files and symbols rather than inventing them. Delegate wide exploration
  to a sub-agent when the surface is large.
- **Planning is read-only.** Make no source edits while building or reviewing
  the plan. Start editing only after the user approves the UI direction.
- **Clarify vs. assume.** Do not ask the user how to build the UI — explore and
  present the direction and options as mockups and tabs. Ask a clarifying
  question only when an ambiguity would change the design and you cannot resolve
  it from the code or a sensible default; batch 2-4 high-leverage,
  decision-changing questions before finalizing. Otherwise state the assumption
  in the plan and proceed.
- **The plan is the approval gate.** Explicitly ask the user to review and
  approve the UI direction before you write any code, and name the files/areas
  the work will touch. Presenting the plan and requesting sign-off is the
  approval step — do not ask a separate "does this look good?" question.

## UI-First Workflow

1. Call `create-ui-plan` with a UI-specific title, brief, source, repo path,
   and structured `content` when you need custom blocks. Otherwise provide
   `states`, `components`, and `implementationNotes` so Plans can generate the
   native editable canvas and document.
2. When the plan has meaningful UI flows, screens, or diagrams, make the top
   of the document a bounded pan/zoom sketch canvas with the key artboards,
   connectors, margin notes, and commentable visual anchors.
   Use the app-owned Rough.js/sketch renderer: subtle grid field, deliberately
   imperfect lines, Virgil-style wireframe labels, and Figma-like annotation
   text/arrows on the top canvas. Labels must sit clear of rough lines,
   connectors, controls, and neighboring notes.
   Treat notes like Figma text layers: sprinkle headings, supporting text,
   bullets, arrows, and labels around the artboards, but do not overlap the
   wireframes or wrap the artboards in explanatory cards.
   In dark mode, keep the canvas field slightly darker than the document, and
   keep wireframe artboards flat rather than shadowed.
3. Continue below the canvas as a restrained, Notion-like interactive document:
   clear prose, horizontal state tabs, inline wireframes, sketchy diagrams,
   tables, vertical code tabs, and concise implementation notes.
4. Skip the top canvas when wireframes or diagrams would not clarify the work;
   in that case, keep the plan as a clean rich document.
5. Put files, symbols, data/actions, migrations, risks, and validation lower in
   the document after the visual review area.
6. Call `get-plan-feedback` before implementation, after review, after a long
   pause, and before the final response. Apply changes with
   `update-visual-plan`. Prefer targeted `contentPatches` for small changes to
   one state tab, wireframe region, canvas frame, code tab, or document block.

## Mockup Quality Bar

- Build high-fidelity screen sections with realistic spacing, controls,
  hierarchy, text, and state-specific content. Avoid vague gray boxes.
- Show the actual workflow the user will use: navigation, toolbar actions,
  forms, dialogs, empty states, error recovery, loading affordances, and
  confirmation/success states.
- Include desktop and mobile/responsive states when layout decisions could
  change. Put them in tabs or adjacent panels rather than burying them in prose.
- Use concrete labels and copy placeholders that expose content length,
  truncation, disabled states, and destructive actions.
- Buttons and primary actions must look actionable: visible affordance,
  readable label/icon, and enabled/disabled treatment when relevant.
- Make state tabs span the plan content width. Small cards are fine for repeated
  items, but the primary UI preview should not be trapped in a tiny thumbnail.
- Keep visuals review-focused, not decorative. Do not make a marketing page,
  hero section, brand deck, or abstract mood board unless the user asks.

## Component And Widget Plans

When the work is a component, popover, sidebar widget, toolbar, card, modal, or
other small surface, do not generate a full app flow. Use compact component
states instead.

- Prefer square or vertical frames that match the component's real footprint.
  A sidebar popover should look like a sidebar popover, not a desktop page or
  phone screen.
- When placement matters, include one broader app-context frame showing the
  surrounding page, sidebar, or toolbar, then focused component states.
- Layered surfaces such as popovers, menus, and floating inspectors need an
  opaque sketch surface so they read as overlays instead of transparent boxes.
- Use state tabs such as `Default`, `Expanded`, `Map`, `Loading`, `Empty`, and
  `Error`. Do not add `Desktop`, `Mobile`, or responsive states unless the
  component actually changes layout across breakpoints.
- Draw only connectors for real sequences. Do not connect independent states
  with fake "Step 1" lines.
- Ground every frame in the real product hierarchy: visible title, controls,
  content groups, state labels, actions, empty/error copy, and realistic
  density. If you have seen a screenshot or component code, reflect it.
- Keep labels outside collision zones. Text must never overlap wireframes,
  connectors, toolbar controls, or neighboring notes.
- Placeholder text strokes should be sparse, aligned, and below labels; avoid
  random-looking gray bars that collide with copy or make the sketch messy. In
  compact cards, use one or two thin strokes or omit strokes rather than filling
  the card with bars.
- Keep every sketch region padded. Labels, placeholder strokes, and buttons need
  visible breathing room from rough borders; avoid edge-hugging component
  layouts.
- Use the app-owned Rough.js/sketch renderer for wireframes and diagrams. The
  result should look deliberately hand-drawn/scribbly with Virgil-style labels,
  not like crisp bordered boxes on a grid. If the rendered plan does not read as
  sketchy, fix the renderer or block data before handing it off.

## State Tabs

When showing multiple UI states, prefer the structured `tabs` block. Each tab
can contain rich text, sketch wireframes, diagrams, code tabs, or bounded custom
HTML fragments. Raw HTML tab attributes are only for legacy imported artifacts.
For UI-first plans, tabs named like component notes, interaction notes, screen
states, or review states should include a relevant visual block unless they are
intentionally document-only; prose-only tabs are usually a sign the plan is
under-specified.

Good state tab sets include:

- `Default`, `Loading`, `Empty`, `Error`
- `List`, `Detail`, `Edit`, `Confirm`
- `Desktop`, `Tablet`, `Mobile`
- `Owner`, `Reviewer`, `Signed out`

## UI Flow Document

Generated `/ui-plan` documents use one default shape: an optional Figma-style
pan/zoom visual preface followed by a refined Notion-like document. There is no
mode boolean. Provide `states` and `components` when the top canvas will help
the reviewer understand the flow; omit them when the plan should be
document-only. Use structured blocks for custom states, diagrams, and code
detail instead of full standalone HTML.

The document below the canvas should still include the same planning substance:
screen states, component notes, implementation map, review prompts, comments,
drawing-friendly space, and agent handoff. Treat it like a designer handed over
a Figma file plus a crisp product spec: the reviewer should understand the UI
flow from a bird's-eye view, then keep scrolling into a clean interactive
document with notes explaining how the screens work together.

## Blocks That Must Not Mislead

- `decision` blocks are static decision records. Do not make them look like
  clickable choices unless the renderer truly supports changing the selected
  option.
- `sketch-diagram` blocks must be readable at a glance: no overlapping node
  labels, no tiny text in oversized empty boxes, and no diagram when a checklist
  or state tabs would communicate better.
- `custom-html` is an escape hatch for bounded fragments only. It must contain
  a complete, useful visual or interaction; never use it as a placeholder,
  empty demo, density ladder, or proof that custom HTML is possible.
- Implementation maps need concrete files and concise snippets. Include
  language metadata so code can be syntax-highlighted; avoid giant prose-only
  file lists.
- Review the rendered plan in the browser before handing it off. Fix overlap,
  excessive whitespace, nonfunctional-looking controls, bad contrast, and
  clipped custom fragments before asking for approval.

## Comments, Drawing, And Handoff

- Add visible annotation prompts beside the mockups: "Comment on layout",
  "Circle unclear copy", "Mark missing state", or "Pick this option". Canvas
  annotations should feel like Figma callouts: plain text plus arrows, without
  card borders, shadows, or background panels unless editing UI is required.
  Place notes close to the frame they explain, aligned with that target frame
  when possible, instead of parking notes in unrelated canvas gaps.
- Leave enough whitespace around key UI regions for drawing and callouts.
- Label important regions so comments can reference them without ambiguity.
- Include an "Agent Handoff" section after the mockups that summarizes the
  chosen UI direction, unresolved visual questions, and feedback that must be
  read before code changes.
- Never claim feedback has been applied until `get-plan-feedback` or the user
  has supplied the feedback in chat.

## Implementation Details Lower Down

After the visual canvas and document review blocks, include a concise
implementation section:

- file paths and symbols/components to touch;
- data/actions/hooks/routes needed for the UI;
- state ownership, optimistic updates, and sync expectations;
- accessibility, responsive, and keyboard considerations;
- test and verification plan;
- short code-shape snippets only where they clarify the implementation.

Do not paste whole files or let implementation prose crowd out the mockups.
The purpose of `/ui-plan` is to get visual direction approved before the agent
starts editing.

## Tool Guidance

- `create-ui-plan`: create the UI-first structured visual plan.
- `create-visual-questions`: ask a rich visual intake form before the UI plan
  when direction-changing answers are needed.
- `update-visual-plan`: revise content blocks, mockups, comments, or handoff notes.
  Prefer targeted `contentPatches` over regenerating the whole UI plan.
- `get-visual-plan`: inspect the current structured plan, exported HTML, and annotations.
- `get-plan-feedback`: read unconsumed reviewer comments before coding.
- `export-visual-plan`: export a review receipt when needed.
