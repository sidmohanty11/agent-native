/**
 * Org-admin gate for the audit-log surface.
 *
 * Placed locally in the template (not in `@agent-native/core`) because
 * "audit log" is an Assets-app feature today; if other templates need it
 * later we'll lift this into core. The check is read-only and only used
 * to gate `list-audit-runs` / `get-audit-run` / `export-audit-csv` and
 * the `/audit` route.
 *
 * Two paths:
 *   1. **Org context present** — query `org_members` for the caller's
 *      role in their active org. Admins and owners pass; members and
 *      guests are rejected with a 403-shaped error. This is the path
 *      that hosted multi-tenant deploys hit.
 *   2. **No org context (single-user / local mode)** — fall back to
 *      "owner-only audits their own runs". The caller is allowed
 *      through but `currentAdminScope()` returns `{ ownerEmail }` so
 *      the action filters to runs owned by the caller. No cross-user
 *      data is exposed.
 *
 * The role lookup intentionally uses raw SQL (not `getOrgContext()`)
 * because actions don't have an `H3Event` — they run inside the
 * request-context ALS established by `runWithRequestContext` and only
 * have email + orgId to work with.
