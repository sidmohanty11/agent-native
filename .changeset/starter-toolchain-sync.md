"@agent-native/core": patch
---

Sync builder-agent-native-starter toolchain files (React Router config, Vite config, server plugins, etc.) alongside the manifest so dependency bumps from templates/chat do not leave the starter in a broken state. Standalone scaffolds now pin tsconfig `baseUrl` to the app root for correct `@/*` path resolution.
