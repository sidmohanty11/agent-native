Server-side Sentry now attaches user/org context to more error paths. Failed login/signup attempts capture as `level:warning` with `tags.auth:login|signup` and the attempted email pinned to `user.email` (filtered to skip routine bad-credential noise). Every `runWithRequestContext({ userEmail, orgId, ... })` invocation now also tags Sentry's per-request isolation scope, so action handlers, agent-chat tool re-entries, integration webhook processors, and A2A calls all surface errors under the right user even when no session cookie was attached to the request.
