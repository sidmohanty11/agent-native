"@agent-native/core": patch

Fix Vite "Failed to resolve import @tauri-apps/api/core" error in fresh CLI workspaces. The settings panel called `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke` directly instead of dynamically importing `@tauri-apps/api/core`, so non-desktop installs no longer crash on the first SPA load.
